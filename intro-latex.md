# Intro to LaTeX

This workshop will introduce you to LaTeX, a typesetting system commonly used in STEM disciplines to create high-quality documents and easily write mathematical equations. We will discuss tools for writing in LaTeX, the structural elements of LaTeX, text formatting, and commands for writing mathematical equations. You will learn the commands to create your first LaTeX document. This session will be recorded and made available openly.

**The recording and materials for this workshop are available here:** <https://learn.scds.ca/intro-latex/>
