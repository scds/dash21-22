# Intro to ArcGIS Online

If you’ve ever thought that a map would help illustrate a critical part of your research, this workshop is for you. At this beginner-friendly session, Christine Homuth (Spatial Information Specialist) will introduce participants to the core concepts of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial data, then show attendees how to apply these concepts during a hands-on exercise where the group will create a web-based map in ArcGIS Online. This session will be recorded and shared publicly.
